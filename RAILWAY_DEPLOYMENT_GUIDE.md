# Railway Deployment Guide

Ready to take your API live? Railway makes it easy. You'll get automatic HTTPS, scaling, and monitoring without the usual headaches.

## Why Railway?

Railway handles all the infrastructure nonsense:
- **Automatic HTTPS** - SSL certificates just work (via Let's Encrypt)
- **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Built-in monitoring** - See what's happening in real-time
- **GitHub integration** - Push to deploy

## How HTTPS works (spoiler: it's automatic)

You literally don't have to do anything. Railway automatically:
1. Gets you an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
2. Renews it before it expires
3. Forces all traffic through HTTPS
4. Handles WebSocket upgrades securely

Your API will be live at:
- `https://acme-logistics-api.up.railway.app` (HTTPS included)

## Data persistence

By default, Railway wipes your filesystem on each deployment. But don't worry - our Terraform config includes a persistent volume that keeps your metrics.json safe between deployments. Your call history won't disappear!

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Railway Token**: Get from [railway.app/account/tokens](https://railway.app/account/tokens)
3. **Terraform**: Install from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
4. **Git Repository**: Push your code to GitHub/GitLab (optional, for auto-deploy)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform/

# Create your variables file from the example
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars

# Edit terraform.tfvars with your actual values
# - acme_api_key: Create a secure key (e.g., use `openssl rand -hex 32`)
# - fmcsa_api_key: Your FMCSA API key
```

### 2. Set Railway Token

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable (recommended)
export RAILWAY_TOKEN="your-railway-token-here"

# Option 2: Add to terraform.tfvars
# railway_token = "your-railway-token-here"
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
# Initialize Terraform (downloads Railway provider)
terraform init

# You should see:
# Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

### 4. Plan Deployment

```bash
# Preview what will be created
terraform plan

# You'll see:
# - railway_project.acme_logistics
# - railway_service.api
# - railway_service.dashboard
# - railway_variable_collection.api_env
# - railway_service_domain.api_domain
# - railway_service_domain.dashboard_domain
```

### 5. Deploy!

```bash
# Apply the configuration
terraform apply

# Type 'yes' when prompted

# After ~2-3 minutes, you'll see:
# Outputs:
# api_url = "https://acme-logistics-api.up.railway.app"
# dashboard_url = "https://acme-logistics-dashboard.up.railway.app"
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Test the API (replace with your API key)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-acme-api-key" \
  https://acme-logistics-api.up.railway.app/healthcheck

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","loads_available":50,"loads_booked":0,...}
```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Project Creation**: Terraform creates a Railway project
2. **Container Build**: Railway detects the Dockerfile and builds your container
3. **SSL Certificate**: Railway automatically requests a Let's Encrypt certificate
4. **DNS Setup**: Railway configures DNS for your subdomain
5. **Deployment**: Your app starts with HTTPS enabled
6. **Health Checks**: Railway monitors your `/healthcheck` endpoint

## Connecting GitHub for Auto-Deploy

If you want automatic deployments on git push:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the API service
3. Go to Settings → Source
4. Click "Connect GitHub"
5. Select your repository
6. Choose the branch (usually `main`)

Now every push to GitHub will automatically deploy!

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain (e.g., `api.acme-logistics.com`):

1. Uncomment the `railway_custom_domain` resource in `main.tf`
2. Run `terraform apply`
3. You'll get a CNAME record to add to your DNS:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: api
   Value: acme-logistics-api.up.railway.app
   ```
4. Railway will automatically provision SSL for your custom domain too!

## Monitoring Your Deployment

1. **Railway Dashboard**: See logs, metrics, and deployments at railway.app
2. **API Logs**: Click on your service → Logs tab
3. **Metrics**: Click on your service → Metrics tab (CPU, Memory, Network)
4. **Healthcheck**: Monitor `https://your-api-url/healthcheck`

## Updating Your Deployment

### Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Edit terraform.tfvars, then:
terraform apply
```

### Update Code
```bash
# If connected to GitHub:
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys

# If not using GitHub:
railway up  # From your project directory
```

### Scale Your Service
```bash
# Edit main.tf to add regions/replicas
# In railway_service "api" block, add:
regions = [{
  region       = "us-west-2"
  num_replicas = 2
}]

terraform apply
```

## Security Notes

✅ **HTTPS is automatic** - All traffic is encrypted with TLS 1.3
✅ **API Key Required** - All endpoints need `Authorization: Bearer {key}`
✅ **Environment Variables** - Sensitive data stored securely in Railway
✅ **Private Project** - Your code and logs are private by default
✅ **Non-root Container** - Dockerfile uses non-root user for security

## Production considerations

### Upgrading from JSON to PostgreSQL
When you're ready for real production:

1. **Add PostgreSQL to your Railway project**:
   ```bash
   # In terraform/main.tf, add:
   resource "railway_service" "postgres" {
     name       = "postgres"
     project_id = railway_project.acme_logistics.id
     source_image = "postgres:15"
   }
   ```

2. **Update your code** to use SQLAlchemy instead of JSON files
3. **Migrate existing data** from metrics.json to PostgreSQL

### Why upgrade?
- **Better performance** at scale
- **Concurrent writes** without conflicts
- **SQL queries** for analytics
- **Automatic backups** from Railway

For now, the persistent volume works great for demos and small deployments!

## Troubleshooting

### "Method Not Allowed" Error
- Make sure your HappyRobot webhook uses the full URL with path
- Example: `https://acme-logistics-api.up.railway.app/api/v1/offers/log`

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Check that `ACME_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly
- Verify the Authorization header format: `Bearer your-key-here`

### Build Failures
- Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure all files are committed to Git (if using GitHub deploy)

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Railway handles this automatically
- If using custom domain, ensure DNS is configured correctly
- Certificates renew automatically - no action needed

## Cost Estimation

Railway pricing (as of 2024):
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month (includes $5 of usage)
- **Usage**: ~$0.01/GB RAM/hour
- **Estimated Monthly**: $5-10 for a small API

Your API is lightweight, so costs should be minimal!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy with Terraform
2. ✅ Verify HTTPS is working
3. ✅ Update HappyRobot webhooks to use new URLs
4. ✅ Test end-to-end flow
5. 📊 Monitor performance in Railway dashboard
6. 🚀 Consider adding custom domain

Congratulations! Your API is now deployed with enterprise-grade security! 🎉
